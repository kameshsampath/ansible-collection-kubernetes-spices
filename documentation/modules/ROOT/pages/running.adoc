= Running Playbooks

The playbooks could be run using the https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[Ansible Execution] environment. 

The collection builds ansible execution environment and publishes them at `quay.io/kameshsampath/kubernetes-spices-ansible-runner`.

== Running a playbook

To run a playbook you need to create directory structure as explained in https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#inputdir[Runner Input Directory Hierarchy]. Once you have that, you can run the playbook like,

[source]
.run.sh
----
docker run -it --rm --name=ansible-runner \
  -v `pwd`:/project \
  quay.io/kameshsampath/kubernetes-spices-ansible-runner
